MediConnect Clinic - – Internship Task 2 focuses on developing a modern static website using Nunjucks for templating and Vite for bundling and build automation.
The objective of this task was to rebuild the deliverables from Task 1 using a structured development workflow and industry-standard tools.

Key achievements include:

* **Templating with Nunjucks:** All pages (`index`, `about`, `contact`) were created using reusable templates for consistency and maintainability.
* **Bundling with Vite:** Automatic compilation and asset management ensures optimized and production-ready output.
* **Folder Structure & Deployment:**

  * `src/templates/` for templates
  * `src/assets/` for CSS and images
  * `dist/` for compiled HTML and assets, uploaded to **GitHub Pages**
* **Challenges Encountered:**

  * Broken image paths after building
  * Blank pages when navigating links
  * Explore Foods anchor link not scrolling
  * GitHub Pages deployment issues

All challenges were resolved by:

* Correcting image paths relative to the `dist` folder
* Ensuring anchor IDs matched navigation links
* Always building before uploading to GitHub Pages
